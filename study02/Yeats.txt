01:The Lake Isle of Innisfree
02:William Butler Yeats
03:
04:I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,
05:And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;
06:Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,
07:And live alone in the bee-loud glade.
08:
09:And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,
10:Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings,
11:There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
12:And evening full of the linnet's wings;
13:
14:I will arise and go now, for always night and day
15:I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
16:While I stand on the roadway, or one the pavements grey,
17:I hear it in the deep core of the heart.
